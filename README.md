# Tuck-Program
POS system for camps' tuck shops.

This program is being built for use in a youth camp to aid the sales of items. The idea is simple: upload accounts and products into the system, then use the shop tab to make purchases. There will be further functionality of analysing data. The idea is not revolutionary - I am working on this 1) to provide a free POS system for my local Youth Movement and 2) for the sake of honing my own skills.

This is still in its early stages of development! It is by no means a finished product.

Please note that the current colour scheme is purely for the sake of providing high colour contrasts between different frames, labels, etc. Please don't judge the program based on the aesthetics at this moment, my priority is a working platform before putting everything in aesthetically pleasing manors.
